**No so secret tips and examples on how to write webpack configs.**

## Config features

### [You don't need a webpack config](examples/no-config)

When no config is provided webpack assumes the following default config:

```js
const {resolve} = require("path");

module.exports = {
    entry: resolve(process.cwd(), "src", "index.js"),
    output: {
        path: resolve(process.cwd(), "dist"),
        filename: "main.js",
    }
};
```

You will still see an error like this in your console:

![](./assets/stdout-error-mode.jpg)

This means that webpack used production defaults because you haven't specified a <code>mode</code>.

The <code>mode</code> has been introduced with webpack 4 and can be set to <code>development</code>, <code>production</code> and <code>none</code>. It allows webpack to choose the best default configuration for the given environment.

**It's strongly recommended to set the <code>mode</code> and let webpack do the rest. ðŸ˜Ž**

You can set the `mode` via the command line...

```sh
webpack --mode development
```

...or inside your webpack config:

```js
module.exports = {
    mode: "development",
};
```

### [You can use TypeScript in your webpack config](examples/typescript)

- Step 1: Rename your `webpack.config.js` to `webpack.config.ts`.
- Step 2: Install `@types/webpack` and `ts-node`.
- Step 3: Create a variable using the `webpack.Configuration` type:

```ts
import webpack from "webpack";

const config: webpack.Configuration = {
    // ...
};

export default config;
```

You also need to set the `esModuleInterop` flag in your `tsconfig.json`:

```json
{
    "compilerOptions": {
        "esModuleInterop": true
    }
}
```

This gives you nice intellisense in your config:

**Note:**
- This is a [webpack-cli](https://webpack.js.org/api/cli/) feature. It won't work if you're using webpack's node API.
- [`ts-node`](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-node) needs to be available in your `node_modules`
- webpack-cli uses [interpret](https://github.com/gulpjs/interpret) which maintains a dictionary of file extensions and associated module loaders.
- This means that you can also use [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) to precompile your `webpack.config.js`. Rename it to `webpack.config.babel.js` and make sure that there is a Babel config.
- Devon Zuegel has written a [comprehensive guide on using TypeScript in your webpack config](https://medium.com/webpack/unambiguous-webpack-config-with-typescript-8519def2cac7).

### [Did you know that your webpack config can also export a function?](examples/function)

The function should return the webpack config:

```js
module.exports = () => {
    return {
        mode: "development",
    };
};
```

Where is that useful?

Now you can pass arguments to your config via webpack's CLI:

```sh
webpack --env.mode=production --env.debug
```

```js
module.exports = (env = {}) => {
    const {
        mode = "development",
        debug,
    } = env;

    return {
        mode,
        output: {
            pathinfo: debug === true,
        },
    };
};
```

This feature is called [Environment Options](https://webpack.js.org/api/cli/#environment-options).

### [Multi-compiler mode](examples/multi)

You can also return an array of configurations. This switches webpack into **multi-compiler mode**:

```js
module.exports = [
    {
        name: "web",
        target: "web",
        output: {
            path: resolve(__dirname, "dist", "web")
        },
    },
    {
        name: "node",
        target: "node",
        output: {
            path: resolve(__dirname, "dist", "node")
        },
    },
];
```

![](./assets/stdout-multi-compiler.jpg)

This is useful for isomorphic apps that need to create two bundles, one for the browser and one for Node.

It's also useful for creating localized bundles:

```js
const I18nPlugin = require("i18n-webpack-plugin");

module.exports = Object
    .entries({
        en: require("./en.json"),
        de: require("./de.json"),
    })
    .map(([language, translations]) => ({
        name: language,
        output: {
            path: resolve(__dirname, "dist", language)
        },
        plugins: [new I18nPlugin(translations)]
    }));
```

In multi-compiler mode webpack builds each config concurrently in the same process while re-using the file system cache.

**Note:**

**Multi-compiler mode does not execute each build in parallel**. Often you will see significant longer build times.

Use [parallel-webpack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/parallel-webpack) from [Trivago](https://tech.trivago.com/), one of our Platinum sponsors, if you want to execute each config in parallel.

### [Async webpack configs](examples/async)

Just put an `async` before your config function:

```js
module.exports = async () => {
    // load some config values from database
    return {
        // ...
    };
};
```

With the language example from the previous tip:

```js
module.exports = async () => {
    const languages = await loadLanguagesFromProvider();

    return Object
        .entries(languages)
        .map(([language, translations]) => ({
            /* ...*/
        }));
};
```

Also the `entry` option can be an async function:

```js
module.exports = {
    entry: async () => loadEntriesFromDb(),
};
```

This can be useful if you're building a static site generator that pulls all entries from a database.

It's not the most important feature but still good to know ðŸ˜‰.

### Loader configuration tips

1.  Prefer `module.rules[].oneOf`
    -   Explain rules
    -   Order of rules is important
1.  Prefer `module.rules[].include` over `exclude`
1.  `module.rules[].resourceQuery` to match on the querystring in a module request like `import text from "./file?raw"` `{ resourceQuery: "?raw", use: "raw-loader" }`
1.  `module.rules[].issuer` to match on the importing module

### Development tips

#### [Use nodemon to reload your webpack config]()

1.  Nodemon to hot-reload the webpack config
2.  Use `require.resolve` when passing absolute paths
3.  Easiest way to use `resolve.alias`: `resolve.alias: { [require.resolve("./some/file")]: require.resolve("./some/other-file") }`
4.  Avoid config splitting

### Speed up webpack build

-   Build time performance `--progress --profile`
-   Use `include`
-   `noParse` to speed up builds
-   Remove unnecessary steps like
    -   Type check
    -   Linting
-   cache-loader
-   thread-loader

### Optimization

-   webpack-bundle-analyzer
-   `maxSize` with HTTP2
    -   Webpack's defaults are usually good enough for most people
    -   If you've already done your homework (reduce JS payload), you can optimize here
    -   The goal: create smaller chunks than can be cached individually
    -   Why? HTTP2 has no head-of-line blocking
    -   The problem: find a good algorithm that selects modules that change often together (you could group by folder structure)
    -   Also problem: GZIP works better with larger files
-   `output.jsonpScriptType: "module"`
    -   Loads async chunks as modules instead of oldschool script tags
    -   Be careful with dependencies: All code is interpreted in strict mode.

### Debugging and error reporting

-   `module.strictExportPresence`
    -   true turns missing export warnings into errors
    -   Could be true for production builds in the future
-   `output.crossOriginLoading: "anonymous"`
    -   Uses the crossorigin attribute when loading chunks
    -   Useful when the bundle is served via a CDN with a different origin
    -   With no attribute, the global error handler will only report "Script error"
    -   https://stackoverflow.com/a/7778424
-   `stats.errorDetails: true` adds more information to errors like "Module not found"
-   `stats.logging: "verbose"`
-   `stats.optimizationBailout` shows which optimization didn't work for which module
    -   Example: Concatenation
-   `output.pathinfo: true`
    -   Enabled in development by default
    -   Disabled in production
    -   Useful to debug production build
